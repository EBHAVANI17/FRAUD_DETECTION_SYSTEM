🛡️ Financial Fraud Detection Model with Machine Learning


📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Fraud detection is crucial for banks, fintech companies, and e-commerce platforms to reduce financial risks and prevent losses.

The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (from Kaggle / TensorFlow repo
), which contains anonymized transaction features.

📂 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Removed duplicates & handled missing values

Engineered features (hour of day, log of amount, robust z-scores)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions

Time patterns, transaction amount patterns

Feature Engineering

Created normalized and transformed features to improve model accuracy

Handling Imbalanced Data

Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance fraud vs. non-fraud samples

Modeling

Classical ML: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Advanced ML: XGBoost, LightGBM

Deep Learning: Autoencoder for anomaly detection

Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC

Fraud detection prioritizes high recall & precision

📊 Results

XGBoost & LightGBM showed strong performance with high ROC-AUC.

Autoencoder successfully detected anomalies with fewer false negatives.

Balanced evaluation between catching frauds (recall) and avoiding false alarms (precision).

📌 Use Cases

🔹 Banking sector: Detect fraudulent credit/debit transactions

🔹 E-commerce: Prevent fake purchases & chargebacks

🔹 Insurance: Detect false claims

🔹 FinTech: Build secure payment systems

🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive fraud detection pipeline using both ML and DL techniques. It highlights the importance of feature engineering, handling imbalanced data, and selecting proper evaluation metrics for real-world fraud detection problems.
